# Operating-systems-assignments
## Assignment 1 - file a1.c
The C file in the operating systems field for handling operations on files and folders includes functions such as opening, closing, reading, writing, and deleting files and directories. It also includes functions for navigating through directories, creating new directories, and checking file permissions. These functions make use of system calls and library functions provided by the operating system, such as fopen(), fclose(), fread(), fwrite(), mkdir(), rmdir(), and chmod(). Overall, the file provides a set of tools for working with files and directories in a low-level, programmatic way.
## Assignment 2 - file a2.c
The C file for this assignment in the operating systems field involves creating Linux processes and threads and synchronizing their executions. The file starts by defining the necessary functions for creating and managing processes and threads, such as fork(), exec(), pthread_create(), and pthread_join(). Next, it defines a synchronization mechanism, such as a semaphore or a mutex, to ensure that the messages are displayed in the correct order. The file then creates a set of processes and threads, each of which displays a few messages using printf() and then terminates. The order in which these messages are displayed is controlled by the synchronization mechanism, ensuring that the messages are displayed in the correct order. Finally, the file cleans up any resources that were allocated during the process, such as closing file descriptors and freeing memory. Overall, this C file demonstrates the use of processes and threads in a synchronized manner to achieve a specific goal.
## Assignment 3 - file a3.c
The C file for this request in the operating systems field involves implementing functions for interprocess communication using pipes, shared memory regions, and memory-mapped files. It defines functions for creating and managing pipes and shared memory regions, as well as mapping files into memory. It also implements functions for different types of requests, such as a pipe-based connection request, creating a shared memory region, memory-mapping a file, and reading from a file offset. This C file provides tools for interprocess communication using different methods and demonstrates their use in achieving this goal.
